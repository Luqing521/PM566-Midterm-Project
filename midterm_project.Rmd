This data set includes indicators which reflect environmental conditions or a populationâ€™s vulnerability to environmental pollutants of all communities in California State.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death both in California and the United States.There are many risk factors for developing CVD including diet, lack of exercise, smoking, and air pollution.

Hypotheses: Is air pollution associated with cardiovascular disease. Is CVD associated with communities category.

- After briefly check the data, most of the variables are complete and the missing data is less than 5%, which is not a huge amount. 
- Rename the column names for further analysis.

-Describe: In the top 20 CVD rate counties, more than half of those belongs to disadvantageous communities.The boxplot shows that disadvantageous communities have relatively higher average of CVD rate than those not.

```

-From the matrix graphs, disadvantageous communities have relatively higher PM2.5 and Ozone pollution exposure and traffic density. Both PM2.5 and ozone are positively corelated with CVD rate in disadvantageous communities. In all communities, traffic density is negatively related with CVD rate.

-An area with a high pollution score is the one that experiences higher pollution burden than areas with low scores. From the state map, we can see Madera, Fresno, Los Angeles, San Joaquin,San Bernadino and Riverside show higher pollution score, this is in consistent with a higher CVD rate in those counties. However, the pollution is not a sufficient cause of CVD rate, because some communities with lower pollution score have higher CVD rate.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
# what is the association between pollution burden score and CVD rate?
table2 <-
ces_2 %>% 
  summarise(county,pol_score1,cardio_mean) %>% 
  arrange(desc(pol_score1))
 head(as.data.table(table2)[,.SD[1],by="county"], 20)
 
 ces_2%>% 
  filter(!pol_score1 %in% NA) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = score_mean, y = cardio_mean))+
  geom_point(aes(color = "red"))+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",color = "black",size=0.5)+
  labs(x=("pollution score"),y=("cardio"),title = ("pollution score and CVD rate by community category"))
 
lm(cardio~pol_score1, data=ces_2) %>% 
  summary()
```

summary:
--The data indicates that air pollution is correlated with CVD occurrence rate, and disadvantageous communities have a relatively higher CVD rate. 
--PM2.5 and Ozone is correlated with CVD rate. Higher PM2.5 and Ozone correspondent to higher CVD rate.
--A higher pollution score indicates that the place experiences higher pollution burden. In top 20 high score counties, more than half of them are disadvantageous communities.
--Pollution exposure is not the sufficient cause of CVD rate. Some communities with lower pollution score have a relative higher CVD rate.
--Some socioeconomic indicators can be used for further analysis.
